==> The process of making of the same function multiple times but sending of the diffrent format of the diffrent parameters with diffrent types
   as the functional value is diffrent is called as the function or method overloading but this type of the concept is not useable for the 
   javascript as it will uses for the other diffrent OOP langauges.
