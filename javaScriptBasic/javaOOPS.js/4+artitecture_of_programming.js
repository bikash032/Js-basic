/* normally we are using the MVC pattern of the programming

 M= Model
 v= View
 c= Controller

lets go for the flow of the programming pattern
At first we makes
1. Routes
2. URL ===> this is defined where what thhe users can do within this space
3. Action controller ====>  business logic, what we going to make throught out.
       ===> Data (define about the users input )
       ===> Validation (to check either all of the useer they inputed data corrected or not)
       ===> Manipulation (to make the user data in the correct format)
       ===> Store (DB) this will model of the data and gives the proper structure for the holding of the data
            table    =====model
            schema   ==== model
4. view (this is as of the UI/UX like the form, data entry space and the notification)



Uses of the class based program in the following spaces
1. Action controller {OOP} class based program
2. store (table+ schema) {OOP} class based programming
3. view === if working on react also follow the class based program
