WHAT IS OOP?
  ==>>>> Object oriented programming 
     basically follow the concept of class and object based programming
            what is class?
         ==>> class is of the representation of the group of the any existing group. Lets have a example for the class called as the fruits, when we think about the fruits then in our mind we can think that having certains images or the features like sweet, source of the vitamin and many more.
            
         WHAT IS OBJECT?
         ==> This is of the instance of the object. lets have a example of the car, as car is class and the properties like
            colour, model, type are the object of the class car. THis is also nothing as it is the instance form of the class.

 
         Technically, class is the blueprint, structure or the behaviour that the object must need to be have.
         The key elements that the class need to be have are
          1. Attributes : These are the variables that hold the data, properties or the state of the object. Car having properties like colour,make,model and so on 

          2. Encapsulation : This is of the binding of the data or the methods of the class or the action it can perform. capsule contain two parts that are wrapped with the coatation. As this is also same where we can wrapped the funtion, methods for the security measure.
            simple word that data is stored inside of the class.
          
          3. Abstraction: This means the getting or taking of the important data structure from the array, object or the 
                data structure is defined but the value is not assign. As later we can use this for the later use.
          
          4. Polymorphism: A single structure can have multiple of its uses

          5. Inheritance: The ability of the other class to copy its properties and its structure
        
                        
          6. Constructor : This is the special method for the initiliazation of the object
                            This is function insde of the class which will be execution very first 
                            This is particularly used for the initialization of values of the properties.
                            This will be executable unless we create at least one of the object(instance) inside of the class.
