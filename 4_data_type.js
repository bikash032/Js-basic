/*TYPES OF DATA IN JS 
there are two types of data types 1. premitive and derived. AS if the data type is already decleared and cannot change and derived is
changing as per our desire.
1. STRING 
If any things that are defined inside of the " ", " ",` `
2. NUMBER 
any of the value that are defined inside of the number 1, 2, -10, 112.5 all of them 
as if its comes inside "123" then it is called as the string 
3. BOOLEAN
  Either true or false
  this always must be of lower case to be write not in the upper case 
  2. we cannot use the keyboard as the let or var or constant as it is already predefined name 
4. Null
null, "", '', ``, false, 0 are all of the false data type
this is of the empty data type
5. Array
1. it is the collection of the data 
2. array are always stored inside of the big bracket 

6. object 
1. Are always inside of the { }
2. They always hold the key:value pairs {name: "Bikash Bishokarma"}

7. JASOn
1. it is the subset of the  object 
2. Full from of JSON ==> JavaScript based Object Notation
3. It is universal data interchange format as this type of data can be read by any of the programming langauge either python, java, c++, etc
FUN fact===> there are three type of the data type which can be read by any of the programming langauge 
1. CSV ==> Comma Separated Values
2.JSON
3. Serialized Object

VVIP Why javaScript is loosly typed language?
1. it is because when we declear the variable then we dont need to pass the value at the same time as it will not give any error and also
dont allocate the memory unless we assign the value there by later 
2. if we delcear the variable as it will be of the any data type then later also we dont need to bind that data type with the variable 
again. let us take an example as
let name = "Bikash Bishokarma"
name = Prakash

let name = "bikash"
 name ="123
console.log(name) then this time we can change the data type for this variable name
fun fact===> The typscript was developed by the microsoft and it is the superset of the javaScript and it is the strongly typed language
and later it is taken by the javascript team and now it is the part of the javaScript in 2015 
and it is the default language for the angular and react and vue.js
in type script we cannot use the 
let name = "bikash"
 name =123
 later also we need to let for the changing of the data type by declearing its data type 



 UNDEFINEd 
 this is just declearing the variablel name and later we can use for the assigning the value to the variable name




 to check the data type of any in JS we can use the syntex as
 
*/
let a= "Bikash"
console.log(typeof a)
