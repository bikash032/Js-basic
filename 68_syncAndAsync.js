/*what is synchrous and asynchrous function?
generally we works on the two types of functio or call
in sychrous function we call one function and the another will be call after the execution the first one  
in this function that the execution of the function are done by serailly as from one and another


if the multiple of the statement are called and they are executed as the parally  as one after another is called as the asynchrous call
here we can call multiple of the function one time


in java script we commonly works with the asynchrous function


as we works with the asynchrous call so that we need to handel them as 
we create the asynchrous function by two ways 
1. by delaying or giving the time set of the execution 
2. another will be slow by process of execution that we must not need to create

now if we need to create the delay of time then we can use the following below function

==>> 1. setTimeout() function
*/
setTimeout()// ==> this function create the delay
