// to be of the loop componenet there must be three steps as loop initilization, loop condition or expression and loop updation
// lets have a look for while loop




let a = 100; // this is of the loop initilazation
while (a <= 120) {
  // this is of the loop condtion or of the expression
  console.log(a);
  a++; // this is of the loop update
}

// lets have look for the do while loop

let b = 1;   // this is of the initilization of the loop
do {
  console.log(b);
  b++;           // this is of the updation of the loop
} while (b<=10);  // this is of the condition of the loop 


/* ************* DIFFERENT BETWEEN WHILE AND DO WHILE LOOP  **********************
AS this both of them will execute the same things. 
in while loop if the statement that is not satisfied then it will not execute any things 
but in the case of while loop the execution will be once any how execute either the expression will be true or false
