*****************use of the git for the office use*************************


as when we are working on the office we are not able send that code to the main group or the deployment space 

before we are pushing to code we need to make the pull request for our seniour developers for the review of the code, this
is important while we working on the team, makes your correction of the code and also of the share of the ideas or the 
logic among all of the co-worker



for this we need to crate the pull request 
there are certain pre-defined branches in the reposatory as like main, sub branch
main branch is not mostly used by the any one even the ceo or the team leader or PM it is because this type of the main branch are
used for the final deployment time as it contain most of the successed code inside there so none of people is pusing or pulling that code 


there are three types of the branches in the reposatory 
1. devloper server 
==>> Most of the developed of the code by the developeres they assign here as for the testing for the QA or the freedom space over where 
    authorized people can pull push the code 

    as if the QA test all of developer code from here and if there is bug and any error then they are sent back to the developer for 
    fixing of the code and

    if there is no any bug or error then that time the QA will deploy to the another server as called as 
2. staging server 
   ==> by this stage even the QA also simply check the code and this stage 
   the code are checked by the project manager with the client and if there is any bug or any requirement that are not fullfill for
    the client or if something we need to make change for the projeect then it will sent back again to the developer server


    after if the client is satisfied and said the project is ok then that code will be diployed to 

3. Live server 
====> this  is of the final and the live user interiface of the execution of the code 

aslo called as the production of the server 

***********      PULL REQUEST   *****************


So as we are being of the juniour developer or of the developer we cannot push the code straight to the developer server, so for this we 
need to work throug the creating of the pull request.

WHAT IS PULL REQUEST?
==> As when we writing our code with our team then that time befor pushing of the code to server we need to ask for other our team members for 
  reviewing of the our code. that type of the request is called as the pull request. as when we assign someone for the pull request that request 
  will be sent through the email by notifying them. we can send pull request to the approved members of that team as many as we desired. this 
  is mostly important and good habit for the programmer even of the company have no policies as like this.


    HOW TO CRATE THE PULL REQUEST?
    1. Just simply go for the pull request button from git hub reposatory 
    2. there is two option as base and compare 
         base => is the main where you want to create the pull request
         compare==> from which branch to which branch we need to send that pull request


         we cannot create the pull request until we make our code to be able for the merge. as if we are not able to merge the code until that 
         we cannot create the pull request as in the section of the pull reqquest there will may include that your code got conflict if there is 
         no proper merging of the code.


         while we creating the pull request we need to follow the right hand side instruction or need to fullfill as like
         1. reviewers===> can be many within of the team members\ you cannot make own as the reviewers
         2. assiginees===> for now i can make myself
         3. what type of the reviewing portin you assign for the reviewers like bug, documentation, or what.
         

         now after this all of the reviewing is done there is the place where it says that the code is ready to merge
